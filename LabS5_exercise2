%% Lab S5- Removing Interference from a Speech Signal using Nulling Filters
%% Part A: Loading the speech signal(speech.mat), listening and plotting the spectrogram of the corrupted signal(xxbad)

%% Part B: Designing a cascade of two Second order Nulling Filters
% Filter coefficients printed as bb
null_frequencies = f_interference*((2*pi)/fs);

filter_coeff_1= [1 -2*cos(null_frequencies(1)) 1];
filter_coeff_2= [1 -2*cos(null_frequencies(2)) 1];

bb=conv(filter_coeff_1,filter_coeff_2) %bb is the filter coefficients of cascade of two Second order Nulling Filters

%% Part C: Plotting the frequency response of the cascaded nulling filter
% nulling frequencies printed are  plus or minus 1.7452*pi and 1.2213*pi
ww = -pi:(pi/1000):pi; % Omega hat frequency vector
H = freqz(bb,1,ww);

%% Part D: Processing the corrupted signal through the Nulling filter and comparing the results.

good_signal=conv(bb,xxbad);

for i=1:length(good_signal)   % Since the good speech signal was scaled so that its max value is 1, we remove outliers
    if abs(good_signal(i))>1
        good_signal(i)=0;
    end
