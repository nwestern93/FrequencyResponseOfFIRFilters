### Overview

In order to run Lab P12 all you need to do is click run from the main.m script within the folder at the top or run each section to view each portion independently if desired.
In order to run Lab S5 you may want to run the sections independently within main.m as to avoid voice overlap between unfiltered and filtered data. Compressed zip files contain respective main.m scripts for each lab (P12 and S5) in addition to the html content.
